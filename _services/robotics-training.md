# Objectives

Our training sessions are tailored to your goals, whether you're a research institution, industrial user, or STEM educator. The objectives of our product training include:

1. Ensuring safe and efficient operation of quadruped or humanoid robotic systems.
2. Providing technical understanding of hardware and embedded control modules.
3. Teaching software integration, including SDKs, ROS/ROS2 compatibility, and AI application layers.
4. Supporting project success through simulation, real-world deployment, and diagnostics.

## Training Success Story

We recently conducted a 2-day onsite training for a research group at [University Name], enabling their students to implement a ROS-based control loop and deploy real-time path tracking on a quadruped platform.

> “Libot’s technical depth and practical guidance made the whole process incredibly smooth.”
